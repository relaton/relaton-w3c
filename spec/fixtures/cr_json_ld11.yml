    JSON is a useful data serialization and messaging format.
        This specification defines JSON-LD 1.1, a JSON-based format to serialize
        Linked Data. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed
        systems that already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from
        JSON to JSON-LD.
        It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based
        programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to
        store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines.
